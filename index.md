# A Collection of Examples
{: .fs-9 }

Since 2011 I've been collecting, creating, and sharing examples for how to approach and or solve problems with TouchDesigner.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Getting started
I've tried all sorts of different mechanics for sharing and writing about these discoveries, and this time around I'm hoping to land on something a little more friendly and extensible. Something that keeps all the examples out of a `TOE` file and out of a folder with all manner of `TOX` files. This interface instead is totally empty - instead it pulls a `TOX` remotely from the web and loads in your local `TouchDesigner` instance. 

The big idea here is to make it easy for you to see fresh examples on the regular without needing to download a new repository or manage lots of files. All of that silliness should be seamless and make sure you can look through examples quickly and easily. 

With that in mind, start exploring the examples. You can use the icon on the top right to see a drop down of all examples with categories. Each example has space for some text description, the ability to load that example, or to jump right into the network.
