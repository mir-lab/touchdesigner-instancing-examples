An example made back when I hardly knew what I was doing â€” the principle of this exercise was seemingly simple. It started with a question about whether each instance could have a unique look-at style rotation. This example explores just that question. Here there are six arrows pointing towards a corresponding sphere whose movement is random. A line acts as ray that passes from the tip of the arrow through the sphere to visually debug the scene and ensure that our rotation is working correctly.
