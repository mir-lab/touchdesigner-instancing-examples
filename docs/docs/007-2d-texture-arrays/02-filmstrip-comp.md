Similar to our previous example, here we also use a **texture3D TOP** that's set to pre-fill. Here our instances are arranged based on a vertical line. The border dressing done in textures creates the illusion of a film strip. Finally, we use a **math CHOP** to seamlessly snap our filmstrip back to the top at a regular interval.
