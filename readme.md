# TouchDesigner Community Examples

Since 2011 I've been collecting examples for how to sovle problems in TouchDesigner. Along the way I've built tox loaders, example networks, and all sorts of different ways for exploring educational content. Some of been a great success, others not so much. As I started to think about how to polish up some examples I wondered if I shouldn't rethink how I was handling these networks. 

This project is attempt to better approach some of those challenges. In this repo you'll only find the documentation that goes along with examples. This repo uses `just-the-docs` by @pmarsciell to keep a nice and tidy set of documentation that's used as a companion to a repo that loads remote toxes on demand. It's a different approach than I've used before, but it helps keep the learning tools simpler to navigate and lighter to download. The idea is that a TouchDesigner novice (or expert) shouldn't need to jump through lots of hoops to get to the interesting examples - as long as they have an internet connection, it should be as easy as clicking a button. 

Here's hoping this idea grows some legs!
